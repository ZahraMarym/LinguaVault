This MERN project integrates advanced audio processing with natural language models to deliver a comprehensive audio recognition and translation system. It utilizes two pretrained models from Hugging Face, including Wav2Vec, a state-of-the-art model for audio feature extraction. The primary goal is to enable users to match an audio sample with a database, accurately identify the closest match using extracted audio features, and perform automatic transcription and translation.

<b>Key Features:</b></br>
<ul>
  <li>Audio Matching: Users can input an audio sample, which the system processes to extract key features such as pitch, frequency, and patterns. These features are then compared against a database of stored audio files to find the closest match.</li>

<li>Automatic Transcription: The system transcribes the spoken words into text using pretrained speech recognition models once the audio is matched. This is powered by Wav2Vec, known for its high accuracy in recognizing speech in noisy environments.</li>

<li>Translation from English to Urdu: After transcription, the text is passed to a translation model, which translates the transcribed text from English to Urdu. This feature is useful for bilingual or Urdu-speaking users who need English audio converted into their native language.</li>
</ul>
<b>Pretrained Models:</b></br>
<ul>
<li>Wav2Vec: A powerful model for speech recognition that focuses on extracting useful features from audio data.</li>
<li>Hugging Face Models: The project incorporates Hugging Face's resources, leveraging pretrained models for both transcription and translation tasks. </li>
</ul>
<b>Limitations:</b></br>
The project's main limitation is its support for languages. While it currently focuses on English-to-Urdu translation, expanding the language repertoire remains a future challenge. Additionally, the accuracy of translation can vary based on the complexity of the input language.
</br>
In summary, this project offers a seamless way to process, transcribe, and translate audio, bridging language gaps with the help of advanced machine learning models.
